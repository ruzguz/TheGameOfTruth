# TheGameOfTruth


**A game made for 6 days game jam with the theme "What is reality?****"**

The game of truth is a 2D is survival game. The goal is protect the patient and kill the ghosts. I developed all game features from scratch including player movement, Enemies, Shooting, Level Generation and more Using C# Scripting and Unity as a Game Engine.

I draw all sprites using Adobe Photoshop and downloaded the SFXs from  [https://freesound.org/](https://freesound.org/)
